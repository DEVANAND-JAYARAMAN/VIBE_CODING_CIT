 what actually works today: 
 
➡️ Clear Structure – Education, Skills, Experience, Projects, Achievements in a clean, logical order. 
 
➡️ Proof, not claims – Instead of writing “Good in Python”, write “Built an ML model improving accuracy by 12% using Python.” 
 
➡️ ATS-friendly formatting – Use simple fonts, no fancy graphics, same font-size and consistent headings. 
 
➡️ Tailoring for each role – If you use the same resume for every job, it would not match the specific requirements of any job. 
 
➡️ Highlight uniqueness – Certifications, awards, personal projects that stand out.
